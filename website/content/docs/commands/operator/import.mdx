# operator import

The `operator import` command imports secrets from external systems in to Vault.
Secrets with the same name at the same storage path will be overwritten upon import.

~> **NOTE:** This has the potential to be a long-running process. Import plans can be
written to read from as many sources as desired and each source may migrate as many
secrets as requested based on filters. 

## Examples

Execute an import config file named import.hcl to generate an import plan:

```shell-session
$ vault operator import -config import.hcl plan
```

Output:

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

	-----------
	Import plan
	-----------
	The following namespaces are missing:
	* ns-1/

	The following mounts are missing:
	* ns-1/mount-1

	Secrets to be imported from the source "my-dest-1":
	* secret-1
	* secret-2

</CodeBlockConfig>

## Configuration

The `operator import` command uses a dedicated configuration file to specify the source,
destination, and mapping rules.

```hcl
source_gcp {
  name = "my-gcp-source-1"
  credentials = "@/path/to/service-account-key.json"
}

destination_vault {
  name = "my-dest-1"
  address = "http://127.0.0.1:8200/"
  token = "root"
  namespace = "ns-1"
  mount = "mount-1"
}

mapping_passthrough {
  name = "my-map-1"
  source = "my-gcp-1"
  destination = "my-dest-1"
  priority = 1
}
```

## Usage

The following flags are available for the `operator import` command.

- `-config` `(string: "<import.hcl>")` - Path to the import configuration HCL file. If unspecified,
a file named import.hcl will be automatically looked for.

- `auto-approve` `(bool: <false>)` - Automatically skips the user-input requirement of "yes" when
  running the "apply" command.

- `auto-create` `(bool: <false>)` - Automatically creates any missing namespaces and mounts when
  "running the "apply" command.

- `-log-level` ((#\_log_level)) `(string: "info")` - Log verbosity level. Supported values (in
  order of descending detail) are `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, and `error`. This can
  also be specified via the `VAULT_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable.
