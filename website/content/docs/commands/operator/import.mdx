# operator import

The `operator import` command imports secrets from external systems in to Vault.
Secrets with the same name at the same storage path will be overwritten upon import.

This is potentially a long-running process as the importer can be configured to read
as many secrets as the import plan specified and from multiple external systems.

## Examples

Execute an import config file named import.hcl to generate an import plan:

```shell-session
$ vault operator import -config import.hcl plan

-----------
Import plan
-----------
The following namespaces are missing:
  * ns-1/

The following mounts are missing:
  * ns1/mount-1

Secrets to be imported from the source "my-dest-1":
  * secret1
  * secret2
...
```

## Configuration

The `operator import` command uses a dedicated configuration file to specify the source,
destination, and mapping rules.

```hcl
source_gcp {
  name = "my-gcp-source-1"
  credentials = "@/path/to/service-account-key.json"
}

destination_vault {
  name = "my-dest-1"
  address = "http://127.0.0.1:8200/"
  token = "root"
  namespace = "ns-1"
  mount = "mount-1"
}

mapping_regex {
  name = "my-map-1"
  source = "my-gcp-source-1"
  destination = "my-dest-1"
  priority = 1
  expression = "^database/.*$"
}
```

## Usage

The following flags are available for the `operator import` command.

- `-config` `(string: <required>)` - Path to the import configuration HCL file.

- `auto-approve` `(bool: <false>)` - Automatically skips the user-input requirement of "yes" when
  running the "apply" command.

- `auto-create` `(bool: <false>)` - Automatically creates any missing namespaces and mounts when
  "running the "apply" command.

- `-log-level` ((#\_log_level)) `(string: "info")` - Log verbosity level. Supported values (in
  order of descending detail) are `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, and `error`. This can
  also be specified via the `VAULT_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable.
