# ReadMore
ReadMore components are used to wrap long text that wed like to show as one line initially with the option to expand and read.
Text which is shorter than the surrounding div will not truncate or show the See More button.
**Example**  
```hbs preview-template
<ReadMore>My <em>super</em> long text goes in here</ReadMore>
```
